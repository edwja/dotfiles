# guard-rspec package

Run Guard RSpec in the background of Atom and have it warn you when failures occur.

To get started simply toggle the package (ctrl + alt + o) or through `packages -> guard-rspec -> toggle`.
This will start guard and inform you when any failures occur.

Please note: you must have `guard-rspec` installed for this to work.
